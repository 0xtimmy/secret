                After we closed Avalon I spent a week with my grandparents going through their study.
                They had boxes of postcards, printout pictures, letters, and photos from even before my grandmother came to america.
                I am often afraid that the lives of my friends, my family, and myself,,, the adventure and joy we share, will be forgotten.

                At some point, you mentioned that, if I wanted to make a photo album, I should use instagram. 
                But instagram feels,,, off? 
                It's not a medium I'm familiar with. R2 buckets, however... >:)

                Anyway, I thought it would be nice to put together a little collection of memories from our six months together.

                I may be far away, but you're always right here in my thoughts.
