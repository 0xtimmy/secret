                After we closed Avalon I spent a week with my grandparents going through their study.
                They had boxes of postcards, printout pictures, letters, and photos from even before my grandmother came to america.
                I am often afraid that the lives of my friends, my family, and myself,,, the adventure and joy we share, will be forgotten.

                Anyway, I thought it would be nice to put together a little collection of memories from our six months together. 
                We'll have to make a real paper and glue one at some point but while we're long distance I hope this works :)

                I may be far away, but you're always right here in my thoughts.
